# odin-recipes
This recipes project is a showcase of everything learned in the HTML Foundations section of The Odin Project.
The project contains many basic HTML elements, such as paragraphs, headings of various sizes, ordered and unordered lists, images, and links to other pages. Each recipe page also has a link back to the home page.
